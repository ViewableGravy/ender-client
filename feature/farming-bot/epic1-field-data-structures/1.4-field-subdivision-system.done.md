# Story FB-1.4: Implement Field Subdivision System

**Story ID**: FB-1.4  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Field Data Structures  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: P1  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Create a flexible subdivision system that allows splitting fields into smaller segments, enabling different crops or quality zones within a single field boundary.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `FieldSubdivision.java` interface
- [ ] Implement `RectangleSubdivision.java` (rows/columns)
- [ ] Implement `CircleSubdivision.java` (radial segments)
- [ ] Support configurable subdivision counts (2, 4, 5, 8, etc.)
- [ ] Each subdivision returns a `FieldGrid` representing its area
- [ ] Add `getSubdivision(int index)` method
- [ ] Add `getAllSubdivisions()` method
- [ ] Ensure no tile overlap between subdivisions
- [ ] Handle edge cases (very small fields, odd counts)

## Technical Notes
- Subdivisions allow different crops in different parts of same field
- Circle subdivisions should use "pie slice" radial segments
- Each subdivision acts as an independent mini-field
- May need to store subdivision metadata in `FarmField`

**Example radial subdivision** (for circles divided into 5):
- Each segment is 72 degrees (360/5)
- Segment 0: 0-72°, Segment 1: 72-144°, etc.

## Files to Create/Modify
- **Create**: `src/auto/farming/model/subdivision/FieldSubdivision.java` (interface)
- **Create**: `src/auto/farming/model/subdivision/RectangleSubdivision.java`
- **Create**: `src/auto/farming/model/subdivision/CircleSubdivision.java`
- **Create**: `src/auto/farming/model/subdivision/SubdivisionConfig.java`

## Dependencies
- FB-1.3 (FieldGrid)

## Testing Notes
- Test rectangle subdivisions with 2, 4, 6, 8 segments
- Test circle subdivisions with 4, 5, 8 segments
- Verify no tile overlap between adjacent segments
- Test edge cases (1x1 field, very large fields)
- Verify total tile count matches original field

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
