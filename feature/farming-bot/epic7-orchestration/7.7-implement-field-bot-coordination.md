# FB-7.7: Implement Field Bot Coordination

**Story ID**: FB-7.7  
**Epic**: Epic 7  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-7.7: Implement Field Bot Coordination

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Modify QuantityFieldBot and QualityFieldBot to integrate with scheduler
- [ ] Add scheduler callbacks to bots:
- [ ] Implement cooperative pausing (bots respond to scheduler pause)
- [ ] Handle work interruption (scheduler reassigns higher priority work)
- [ ] Report bot status to scheduler each tick
- [ ] Ensure only one bot active per character at a time

## Technical Notes
- Bots transition from independent operation to scheduler-driven
- Scheduler may interrupt low-priority work for urgent tasks
- Status reporting enables scheduler to make informed decisions

#### Files to Modify
- `src/auto/farming/bot/QuantityFieldBot.java`
- `src/auto/farming/bot/quality/QualityFieldBot.java`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
