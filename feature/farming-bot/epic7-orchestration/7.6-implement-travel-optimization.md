# FB-7.6: Implement Travel Optimization

**Story ID**: FB-7.6  
**Epic**: Epic 7  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P1  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-7.6: Implement Travel Optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `TravelOptimizer.java` class
- [ ] Calculate travel time between fields
- [ ] Factor travel time into scheduling decisions
- [ ] Implement field clustering: batch nearby fields together
- [ ] Calculate optimal field visiting order (TSP-like problem)
- [ ] Cache travel time estimates
- [ ] Use current character position in calculations
- [ ] Bias toward nearby fields when priorities equal
- [ ] Support manual field ordering override

## Technical Notes
- Traveling salesman problem (TSP) for optimal route
- Use greedy nearest-neighbor for fast approximation
- Pre-calculate field distances at startup
- Consider: is travel time worth optimizing vs just processing by priority?

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/auto/farming/scheduler/TravelOptimizer.java`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
