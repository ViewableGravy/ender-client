# FB-7.1: Design Multi-Field Scheduling Architecture

**Story ID**: FB-7.1  
**Epic**: Epic 7  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-7.1: Design Multi-Field Scheduling Architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design architecture for multi-field coordination
- [ ] Define scheduling algorithm and priorities
- [ ] Document field state priorities:
- [ ] Design resource locking mechanism (prevent concurrent chest access)
- [ ] Create sequence diagram for multi-field workflow
- [ ] Define performance targets (handle 10+ fields efficiently)

## Technical Notes
- Priority system ensures urgent work (harvesting) happens first
- Resource locks prevent race conditions (two bots accessing same chest)
- Consider travel time in scheduling: prioritize nearby fields
- Balance: high-priority urgent work vs efficient batching

## Files to Create/Modify
- `feature/farming-bot/docs/MULTI-FIELD-SCHEDULING-DESIGN.md`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
