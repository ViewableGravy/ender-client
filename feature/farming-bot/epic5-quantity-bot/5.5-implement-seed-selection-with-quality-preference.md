**Story ID**: FB-5.5  
**Epic**: Epic 5  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-5.5: Implement Seed Selection with Quality Preference

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `SeedInventoryManager.java` class
- [ ] Scan inventory for seeds matching field crop type
- [ ] Filter seeds by quality range (-4 to +5 for quantity fields)
- [ ] Sort seeds by quality (highest first, even for quantity)
- [ ] Select best available seed for planting
- [ ] Track seed count for restocking decisions
- [ ] Handle mixed-quality seed stacks
- [ ] Return null if no suitable seeds available

## Technical Notes
- Quality preference: even quantity fields benefit from higher quality seeds
- Seed quality stored in item tooltip or GItem attributes
- May need to iterate inventory multiple times to find all seeds
- Cache inventory state to avoid repeated scans

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/auto/farming/bot/SeedInventoryManager.java`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
