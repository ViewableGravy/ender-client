## Description
Implementation of FB-5.4: Implement Tilling Logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `handleTilling()` state handler
- [ ] Process tiles from tilling work queue
- [ ] Execute tilling actions using `FarmingActions.tillTile()`
- [ ] Update tile state after successful till
- [ ] Handle tilling failures (retry up to 3 times)
