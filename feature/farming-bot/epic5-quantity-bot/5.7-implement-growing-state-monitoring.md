**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-5.7: Implement Growing State Monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `handleGrowing()` state handler
- [ ] Periodically scan field for harvestable crops (every 60 seconds)
- [ ] Detect when crops reach harvestable state
- [ ] Transition to HARVESTING when any crops ready
- [ ] Add configurable scan interval
- [ ] Show estimated time until harvest (if determinable)
- [ ] Handle crops maturing at different rates

## Technical Notes
- Growing state is mostly idle, just periodic checks
- Use `TileDetector` to check growth stages
- May be able to estimate harvest time from growth stages
- Don't scan too frequently to avoid performance impact

#### Files to Modify
- `src/auto/farming/bot/QuantityFieldBot.java`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
