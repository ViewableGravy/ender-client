# FB-5.3: Implement Field Initialization

**Story ID**: FB-5.3  
**Epic**: Epic 5  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-5.3: Implement Field Initialization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `handleInitializing()` state handler
- [ ] Scan all tiles in field to determine current state
- [ ] Build work queues:
- [ ] Estimate time to complete each phase
- [ ] Determine initial state based on field scan
- [ ] Cache tile states for performance
- [ ] Handle large fields efficiently (>500 tiles)
- [ ] Transition to appropriate next state

## Technical Notes
- Use `TileDetector` from Epic 4 to scan field
- Batch tile scanning: process 50 tiles at a time to avoid lag
- Build priority queues: process tiles in optimal order
- Estimate time based on tile count and action durations
