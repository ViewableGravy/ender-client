# FB-5.1: Design Quantity Field State Machine

**Story ID**: FB-5.1  
**Epic**: Epic 5  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-5.1: Design Quantity Field State Machine

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design state machine diagram for quantity field lifecycle
- [ ] Define states:
- [ ] Define state transitions and conditions
- [ ] Document expected behavior in each state
- [ ] Create state machine implementation class

## Technical Notes
```
INITIALIZING → TILLING (if untilled tiles exist)
           → PLANTING (if tilled tiles exist and seeds available)
           → HARVESTING (if harvestable crops exist)
           → GROWING (if all planted, nothing harvestable)
           → IDLE (if field complete)

TILLING → PLANTING (when all tiles tilled)
       → ERROR (if no hoe and tiles need tilling)

PLANTING → GROWING (when all tiles planted)
        → RESTOCKING (if no seeds)
        
HARVESTING → STORING (when inventory full or all harvested)
          → TILLING (if field cleared, start new cycle)

STORING → HARVESTING (if more crops to harvest)
       → TILLING (if done harvesting)
       
RESTOCKING → PLANTING (when seeds acquired)
          → ERROR (if no seeds in storage)

GROWING → HARVESTING (when crops harvestable)
       → GROWING (continue waiting)

ERROR → IDLE (when error resolved)
```
