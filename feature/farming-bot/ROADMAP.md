### Sprint Breakdown

**Note**: With corrected story points (1 SP ≈ 2 hours), sprints adjusted for realistic team velocity.

Assuming a team of 3-4 developers with a velocity of 80-100 SP per 2-week sprint:

| Sprint | Weeks | Focus | Key Deliverables | Story Points |
|--------|-------|-------|------------------|--------------|
| Sprint 1 | 1-2 | Data models, overlay start | Epic 1: 50%, Epic 2: Start | ~80 SP |
| Sprint 2 | 3-4 | Complete Epic 1, overlay progress | Epic 1: 100%, Epic 2: 50% | ~80 SP |
| Sprint 3 | 5-6 | Overlay complete, UI start | Epic 2: 100%, Epic 3: Start | ~90 SP |
| Sprint 4 | 7-8 | UI completion | Epic 3: 100% | ~90 SP |
| Sprint 5 | 9-10 | Farming actions start | Epic 4: 50% | ~90 SP |
| Sprint 6 | 11-12 | Farming actions complete, quantity bot start | Epic 4: 100%, Epic 5: Start | ~90 SP |
| Sprint 7 | 13-14 | Quantity bot progress | Epic 5: 60% | ~100 SP |
| Sprint 8 | 15-16 | Quantity bot complete, quality bot start | Epic 5: 100%, Epic 6: Start | ~100 SP |
| Sprint 9 | 17-18 | Quality bot progress | Epic 6: 50% | ~110 SP |
| Sprint 10 | 19-20 | Quality bot complete | Epic 6: 100% | ~120 SP |
| Sprint 11 | 21-22 | Multi-field scheduler | Epic 7: 50% | ~95 SP |
| Sprint 12 | 23-24 | Scheduler complete | Epic 7: 100% | ~95 SP |
| Sprint 13 | 25-26 | Polish & optimization | Epic 8: 40% | ~90 SP |
| Sprint 14 | 27-28 | Documentation & QA | Epic 8: 70% | ~90 SP |
| Sprint 15 | 29-30 | Final polish & release prep | Epic 8: 100% | ~70 SP |

**Total**: 15 sprints (30 weeks) with buffer time

---

## Critical Path

These dependencies must be respected for successful delivery:

```
Epic 1 (Data Structures)
    ├─> Epic 2 (Overlay) ───┐
    ├─> Epic 3 (UI) ────────┤
    ├─> Epic 4 (Actions) ───┴─> Epic 5 (Quantity Bot) ──┐
    └────────────────────────> Epic 6 (Quality Bot) ────┴─> Epic 7 (Scheduler) ──> Epic 8 (Polish)
```

**Critical Path Duration**: 31 weeks minimum (sequential dependencies with 1 developer)  
**With 3-4 developers**: ~17-20 weeks (parallel work on independent epics)

---

## Resource Allocation

### Team Roles & Assignments

| Role | Epics | Workload | Story Points |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Lead Developer** | 1, 4, 7 | 35% - Architecture, core systems, scheduler | ~475 SP |
| **UI Developer** | 2, 3 | 25% - Overlay, field editor, configuration UI | ~270 SP |
| **Bot Logic Developer** | 5, 6 | 30% - Quantity and quality bot algorithms | ~402 SP |
| **QA/Documentation** | 8 | 10% - Testing, docs, polish | ~224 SP |

**Total**: ~1,371 story points

**Parallel Work Opportunities**:
- Epic 2 (Overlay) and Epic 3 (UI) can be developed in parallel (weeks 2-4)
- Epic 5 (Quantity) and Epic 6 (Quality) can be partially parallelized
- Documentation (Epic 8) can start early and run throughout

---

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| Game mechanics differ from assumptions | High | Early prototyping in Epic 4 | Lead Dev |
| Quality detection not feasible | Medium | Research alternatives, fallback strategies | Bot Logic Dev |
| Performance issues on large fields | Medium | Profiling and optimization in Epic 8 | Lead Dev |
| Pathfinding integration complex | Medium | Leverage existing systems, extensive testing | Lead Dev |
| Scope creep / feature additions | High | Strict scope control, defer to v2.0 | Team Lead |

### Contingency Plans

- **Epic 6 Quality Bot Delays**: Can release v1.0 with quantity bot only, quality in v1.1
- **Epic 7 Scheduler Complexity**: Can simplify to single-field mode initially
- **Epic 8 External Monitoring**: Can defer to v2.0, focus on core bot stability
