# FB-2.5: Implement Tile State Visualization

**Story ID**: FB-2.5  
**Epic**: Epic 2  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-2.5: Implement Tile State Visualization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Render individual tiles with color-coded states:
- [ ] Support toggling tile state overlay independently
- [ ] Optimize rendering for fields with 500+ tiles
- [ ] Use batch rendering for performance
- [ ] Add LOD (Level of Detail): simplify rendering when zoomed out
- [ ] Show crop quality as text overlay on tiles (optional toggle)
- [ ] Animate growing stages (subtle pulsing effect)

## Technical Notes
- Each tile is 11x11 units in Haven's coordinate system
- Use filled rectangles for tile backgrounds
- Consider using texture atlas for repeated tile graphics
- Batch all tile drawing into single OpenGL call for performance
- LOD thresholds: 
  - Zoom level > 2.0: Full detail with quality text
  - Zoom level 1.0-2.0: Colored tiles only
  - Zoom level < 1.0: Skip tile rendering, show field summary only
