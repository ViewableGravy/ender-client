### Story FB-8.1: Performance Profiling & Optimization
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P0  

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Profile bot performance with 10+ fields and 500+ tiles each
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks:
  - Tile scanning overhead
  - Pathfinding calculations
  - Overlay rendering
  - Crop quality inspection
  - Memory usage
- [ ] Optimize identified bottlenecks:
  - Cache tile states (avoid repeated scans)
  - Batch pathfinding calculations
  - Implement spatial indexing for fields
  - Reduce object allocations
- [ ] Target performance metrics:
  - <100ms per scheduler tick
  - <5ms overlay rendering per frame
  - <50MB memory overhead for 10 fields
  - 60 FPS maintained with overlay enabled
- [ ] Document optimization strategies

#### Technical Notes
- Use JProfiler, VisualVM, or similar for profiling
- Focus on hot paths (code executed most frequently)
- Consider lazy loading for field data
- Implement object pooling for frequently created objects

#### Files to Create
- `feature/farming-bot/docs/PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION.md`

### Story FB-8.2: Implement Comprehensive Logging System
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: P0  

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `FarmingLogger.java` class with logging levels:
  - TRACE: Extremely detailed (every action, every tile)
  - DEBUG: Detailed debugging info (state transitions, decisions)
  - INFO: General operation info (started, completed cycles)
  - WARN: Warning conditions (low seeds, chest nearly full)
  - ERROR: Error conditions (failures, exceptions)
- [ ] Log to file: `~/.haven/logs/farming-bot.log`

- [ ] Add structured logging with context (field ID, bot state, timestamp)
- [ ] Create log analysis tools (parse logs for errors, statistics)
- [ ] Add UI control for log level (configurable per-session)
- [ ] Include performance metrics in logs (action duration, etc.)

#### Technical Notes
- Use existing logging framework if available, or implement custom
- Structured logs easier to parse: `[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL] [FIELD:uuid] [STATE] Message`
- Log rotation prevents disk space issues
- TRACE level useful for debugging but impacts performance
