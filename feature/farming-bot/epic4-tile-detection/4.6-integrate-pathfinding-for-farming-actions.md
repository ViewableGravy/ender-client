# FB-4.6: Integrate Pathfinding for Farming Actions

**Story ID**: FB-4.6  
**Epic**: Epic 4  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-4.6: Integrate Pathfinding for Farming Actions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `FarmingPathfinder.java` wrapper around existing pathfinding
- [ ] Implement `pathToTile(Coord2d target)` method
- [ ] Calculate optimal position for interacting with tile (adjacent)
- [ ] Handle pathfinding failures (unreachable, blocked)
- [ ] Add movement validation (reached target position)
- [ ] Implement wait-for-arrival logic with timeout
- [ ] Support queuing multiple tile visits for efficiency
- [ ] Add obstacle avoidance and retry logic

## Technical Notes
- Leverage existing pathfinding from `auto/Actions.java` or game's pathfinding
- Character must be adjacent to tile to interact
- Optimize path for visiting multiple tiles in sequence (traveling salesman)
- Handle dynamic obstacles (other players, animals)

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/auto/farming/game/FarmingPathfinder.java`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
