# FB-4.3: Implement Tile State Detection

**Story ID**: FB-4.3  
**Epic**: Epic 4  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-4.3: Implement Tile State Detection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `TileDetector.java` class for analyzing tile states
- [ ] Implement `getTileState(Coord2d worldCoord)` method
- [ ] Detect untilled land (check tile type/overlay)
- [ ] Detect tilled land (plowed/ready for planting)
- [ ] Detect planted crops (Gob present on tile)
- [ ] Identify crop growth stage (young, growing, harvestable)
- [ ] Handle edge cases: multiple Gobs on same tile, partial tile overlap
- [ ] Add caching to avoid repeated checks
- [ ] Support batch tile scanning for field analysis

## Technical Notes
- Use `MapView.glob.oc` to query Gobs at coordinates
- Tilled state may be a tile overlay or specific tile type
- Growth stages may be encoded in Gob resource name or attributes
- Consider performance: scanning 500 tiles should take <100ms

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/auto/farming/game/TileDetector.java`
- `src/auto/farming/game/TileInfo.java` (data class for tile info)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
