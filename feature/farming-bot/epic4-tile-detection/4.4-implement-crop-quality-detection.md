**Story ID**: FB-4.4  
**Epic**: Epic 4  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-4.4: Implement Crop Quality Detection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `CropInspector.java` class for crop analysis
- [ ] Implement `getCropQuality(Gob cropGob)` method
- [ ] Read quality from Gob attributes (GAttrib)
- [ ] Handle different quality representation formats (absolute, relative)
- [ ] Support quality inspection without needing to harvest
- [ ] Add fallback methods if direct quality reading unavailable
- [ ] Cache quality values to minimize Gob inspection overhead
- [ ] Handle crops without quality (e.g., wild plants)

## Technical Notes
- Quality may be in `GobQuality` or similar GAttrib
- May need to interact with crop (right-click inspect) to reveal quality
- Study existing quality display code in `GobInfo` classes
- Quality format: likely integer (0-100) or fractional (0.0-1.0)

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/auto/farming/game/CropInspector.java`
- `src/auto/farming/game/CropQuality.java` (data class)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
