# FB-6.1: Design Quality Breeding Algorithm

**Story ID**: FB-6.1  
**Epic**: Epic 6  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-6.1: Design Quality Breeding Algorithm

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research crop quality genetics in Haven & Hearth
- [ ] Design algorithm for quality improvement:
- [ ] Document breeding strategy and expected progression
- [ ] Define quality threshold formula
- [ ] Create simulation to validate algorithm effectiveness
- [ ] Plan for quality plateau handling (when improvement stalls)

## Technical Notes
- Quality inheritance: crops grown near higher quality crops tend toward higher quality
- Quality range: ±5 from surrounding crops (research needed to confirm)
- Strategy: maintain minimum quality, gradually increase threshold
- Example progression: Avg Q10 → plant Q10-15 → harvest Q12-17 → plant Q15-20 → etc.
