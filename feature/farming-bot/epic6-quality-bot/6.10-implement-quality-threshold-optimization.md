# FB-6.10: Implement Quality Threshold Optimization

**Story ID**: FB-6.10  
**Epic**: Epic 6  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: P1  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-6.10: Implement Quality Threshold Optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `handleOptimizing()` state handler
- [ ] Analyze previous cycle results:
- [ ] Adjust quality thresholds for next cycle:
- [ ] Calculate optimal threshold based on seed availability
- [ ] Set new thresholds in `QualityTracker`
- [ ] Transition to IDLE or TILLING for next cycle
- [ ] Log optimization decisions

## Technical Notes
- Optimization balances quality improvement vs practical constraints
- Aggressive thresholds → faster quality gain but more culling
- Conservative thresholds → slower improvement but less waste
- Adaptive algorithm should find optimal balance over time
