**Story ID**: FB-6.4  
**Epic**: Epic 6  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-6.4: Implement Crop Inspection Logic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `handleInspecting()` state handler
- [ ] Scan field for planted (but not yet harvestable) crops
- [ ] Inspect quality of each growing crop using `CropInspector`
- [ ] Build inspection queue (prioritize crops near harvest)
- [ ] Execute inspection actions (may require right-click inspect)
- [ ] Record inspected quality in `QualityTracker`
- [ ] Identify low-quality crops for culling
- [ ] Transition to CULLING if low-quality crops found
- [ ] Transition to GROWING if all crops acceptable

## Technical Notes
- May need to physically inspect each crop (time-consuming)
- Inspection might only be possible at certain growth stages
- Alternative: inspect seeds before planting instead of crops after
- Prioritize inspection of crops nearing maturity

#### Files to Modify
- `src/auto/farming/bot/quality/QualityFieldBot.java`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
