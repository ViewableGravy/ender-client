**Story ID**: FB-6.7

**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-6.7: Implement Quality-Aware Planting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `handlePlanting()` for quality fields
- [ ] Use `QualitySeedSelector` to choose seeds
- [ ] Only plant if seed quality meets threshold
- [ ] Skip tiles if no suitable seeds (leave tilled for next cycle)
- [ ] Record planted seed quality per tile
- [ ] Update quality tracker with planted quality
- [ ] Calculate expected quality progression
- [ ] Transition to GROWING when planting complete or seeds exhausted
- [ ] Transition to RESTOCKING if need more high-quality seeds

## Technical Notes
- Partial planting acceptable: better to wait for quality seeds than plant poor ones
- Track which tiles planted this cycle for harvest planning
- Consider planting pattern: does positioning affect quality outcome?

#### Files to Modify
- `src/auto/farming/bot/quality/QualityFieldBot.java`

## Definition of Done
