**Story ID**: FB-6.14  
**Epic**: Epic 6  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P1  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-6.14: Create Quality Bot Tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test quality breeding algorithm with simulated data
- [ ] Test crop inspection and culling logic
- [ ] Test quality-aware seed selection
- [ ] Test quality-based storage sorting
- [ ] Test threshold optimization over multiple cycles
- [ ] Test integration with quantity fields
- [ ] Run long-term test: 20 cycles, validate quality progression
- [ ] Document expected quality improvement rates

## Technical Notes
- Simulation can test algorithm without live game
- Live testing required for full integration validation
- Track quality progression over 20+ cycles to validate algorithm

## Files to Create/Modify
- `test/auto/farming/bot/quality/QualityBreedingAlgorithmTest.java`
- `test/auto/farming/bot/quality/QualityFieldBotTest.java`
- `feature/farming-bot/docs/QUALITY-BOT-TESTING.md`

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and compiles without errors
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Javadoc complete
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Committed to feature branch
