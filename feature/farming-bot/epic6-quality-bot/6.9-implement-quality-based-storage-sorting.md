## Description
Implementation of FB-6.9: Implement Quality-Based Storage Sorting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `handleSorting()` state handler
- [ ] Navigate to storage chests (multiple chests for different quality tiers)
- [ ] Sort harvested crops by quality:
- [ ] Transfer crops to appropriate chests
- [ ] Handle chest full scenarios (use next chest or alert)
- [ ] Reserve high-quality crops as seeds for next planting
- [ ] Transition to OPTIMIZING or TILLING for next cycle
- [ ] Update storage statistics

## Technical Notes
- Quality-based sorting requires multiple chest links (configured in Epic 3)
- Premium breeding stock should be clearly separated
- Consider keeping some high-quality crops for consumption vs all for breeding
