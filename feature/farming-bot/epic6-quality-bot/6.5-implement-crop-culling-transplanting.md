# FB-6.5: Implement Crop Culling & Transplanting

**Story ID**: FB-6.5  
**Epic**: Epic 6  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Not Started  

## Description
Implementation of FB-6.5: Implement Crop Culling & Transplanting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `handleCulling()` state handler
- [ ] Identify crops below quality threshold
- [ ] Decide action per low-quality crop:
- [ ] Execute removal actions (harvest early or destroy)
- [ ] For transplanting: coordinate with quantity field bot
- [ ] Update tile state after culling
- [ ] Re-till culled tiles for replanting
- [ ] Transition to PLANTING when culling complete
- [ ] Track culling statistics (culled count, avg quality removed)

## Technical Notes
- Transplanting requires integration with quantity field system
- Early harvest may yield partial crops (handle reduced yield)
- Culling threshold: crops below (field avg - 3) or below absolute minimum
- Consider cost/benefit: is culling worth the effort vs letting crop mature?
