## Description
Implementation of FB-6.11: Implement Quality Field Restocking

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement `handleRestocking()` for quality fields
- [ ] Navigate to seed storage (premium breeding stock chest)
- [ ] Withdraw high-quality seeds (above current threshold)
- [ ] Fallback to main storage if premium insufficient
- [ ] Validate seed quality before taking (don't take low-quality)
- [ ] Calculate needed quantity based on empty tiles
- [ ] Handle no suitable seeds scenario:
- [ ] Return to field after restocking
- [ ] Transition to PLANTING

## Technical Notes
- Premium seed chest should be restocked from previous harvests
- If breeding stock depleted, may need to "import" from another quality field
- Consider seed buffer: always keep some high-quality seeds in reserve
